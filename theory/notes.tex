Mechanistic interpretability review for AI safety \cite{bereska2024}

\section*{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Mechanistic Interpretability for AI Safety" \cite{bereska2024}: Broad surface level review of MI in the context of AI safety
    \item "Everything, Everywhere, All at Once: Is Mechanistic Interpretability Identifiable?" \cite{meloux2025}: Main question of the paper: For a fixed behaviour under criterias that MI sets for itself, is it guaranteed that there exists unique explanaiton?
    \item "Position: An Inner Interpretability Framework for AI Inspired by Lessons from Cognitive Neuroscience" \cite{vilas2024}: Trying to answer possible critisism of MI, e.g. lack of rigor and general framework, the paper describes inner interpretability frameworks derived from the field of Cognitive Neuroscience.
    \item "Mechanistic?" \cite{wiegreffe2024}: Describes the term "mechanistic" in the context of MI, how is it used and presents a history of the NLP interpretability community and formation of the separate MI community.
